             is a self-defence martial art and combat sport based on grappling, ground fighting, 
             and submission holds. BJJ approaches self-defense by emphasizing taking an opponent 
             to the ground, gaining a dominant position, and using a number of techniques to force 
             them into submission via joint locks or chokeholds.

            Students are welcome to spar at their own pace and convenience.
            This activity is highly admired in jiu-jitsu communities
            as it gives a chance to gain something extra from the BJJ athletes
            regardless of their belt levels and affiliations.
            The meeting lasts for two hours or longer and sometimes
            some academies allow open mat invitations every weekend.
