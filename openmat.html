            Open mat BJJ is an opportunity to train and roll with anyone you like.
            Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu open mats invites BJJ athletes from the other gyms
            in their area to come for the purpose of learning something new from each
            other. There is no lesson plan to follow. </p>

            Students are welcome to spar at their own pace and convenience.
            This activity is highly admired in jiu-jitsu communities
            as it gives a chance to gain something extra from the BJJ athletes
            regardless of their belt levels and affiliations.
            The meeting lasts for two hours or longer and sometimes
            some academies allow open mat invitations every weekend.
